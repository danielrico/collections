collections
===========

Demo : http://collections.daniel-rico.com

Collections is a wordpress theme. It's a mashup between a visual bookmarking website and a curated blog à la scoop.it

It will not work out of the box for everybody as some elements are strictly working for my own design (category icons), but feel free to fork it for your own needs.
